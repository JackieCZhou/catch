This project is under construction:

Catch will be a React and Javascript based project for recruiters and job hunters alike. 
Recruiters will be able to save candidates by custom created categories, share with team members and invite potential hires to mettups/interveiws etc.

Those seeking a job can upload all of their hirable materials to one place, auto-share their profile with recrtuiters, join meetups, notify recruiters when their skills have upgraded and connect with people already in the field for mentorship.
